# Quantum Infrastructure Zero (QIZ) Architecture

## Overview

Quantum Infrastructure Zero (QIZ) is a revolutionary approach to distributed computing that eliminates traditional server infrastructure, DNS systems, and conventional routing mechanisms. QIZ enables direct quantum-secured communication between nodes using quantum signatures and post-DNS protocols.

## Core Principles

### Zero-Server Architecture
- No traditional servers or centralized infrastructure
- Peer-to-peer quantum-secured communication
- Self-contained deployment engines
- Autonomous node management

### Zero-DNS Routing
- Elimination of traditional DNS systems
- Quantum signature-based object identification
- Direct node-to-node communication
- Post-DNS logical layer implementation

### Quantum Mesh Protocol (QMP)
- Quantum-secured mesh networking
- Dynamic node discovery and connection
- Quantum entanglement-based synchronization
- Fault-tolerant communication
